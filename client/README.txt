README CS 283: Simple Client/Server, MTServer, and BenchmarkClient
In order to change the port for BenchmarkClient, go to Run Configurations and change
the argument to 3333 for Simple Server and 4444 for MTServer. Make sure to start
the Server before starting the clients!

As seen in the printed lines on the console, there are more "." for the MTServer than the SimpelServer.
With more threads spawning and a longer text allows for the MTServer to do more work.
